BATTLESHIPS GAME

In this personal project I made a battleships game where you can verse a computer in the famous retro game battleships.

The player starts by rearranging their ships, or randomizing the layout with a click of a button, followed by the game starting when
the user is ready.

The player and bomputer both take turns to guess the coordinates of each others ships, and the game ends when either party wins, followed by a game winner message.

Try it out here:
